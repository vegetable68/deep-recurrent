The DT O

at IN O

apparently RB O
simple JJ O
: : O

Eventually RB O

some DT O

In IN O

admitted VBD O

on IN O
18 CD O

2002 CD O

President NNP O

publicly RB O
announced VBD O
two CD O

owing JJ O
to TO O
the DT O
President NNP O

firmness NN O
in IN O
announcing VBG O

seemed VBD O
unyielding VBG O
: : O
first RB O

the DT O
President NNP O
said VBD O
the DT O
158 CD O

were VBD O
not RB O
defined VBN O

therefore RB O

the DT O
United NNP O

does VBZ O
not RB O
believe VB O
it PRP O
is VBZ O
its PRP$ O
duty NN O
to TO O
grant VB O

prisoner-of-war JJ O

under IN O
the DT O

the DT O

In IN O
the DT O
actual JJ O
situation NN O
we PRP O

discussing VBG O

the DT O

the DT O

according VBG O

most RBS O

this DT O

a DT O
very RB O
important JJ O

in IN O
this DT O

the DT O

immediately RB O
when WRB O
the DT O

over RP O

In IN O
all DT O
likelihood NN O
, , O
President NNP O
Bush NNP O
made VBD O
that DT O
statement NN O
on IN O
18 CD O
January NNP O
following VBG O
a DT O

who WP O

strongly RB O
supported VBN O
by IN O

Obviously RB O
, , O
this DT O
decision NN O
simplified VBZ O
things NNS O

and CC O
it PRP O
allowed VBD O
the DT O
US NNP O
judiciary NN O
to TO O
conduct VB O
the DT O
investigation NN O
of IN O
the DT O
158 CD O

as IN O
it PRP O
sees VBZ O

The DT O
United NNP O

wanted VBD O
this DT O
very RB O
much RB O

because IN O
so RB O

the DT O
identity NN O

of IN O

they PRP O
call VBP O
`` `` O

-LRB- -LRB- O

`` `` O

in IN O
Bush NNP O

-RRB- -RRB- O
rather RB O

for IN O
reasons NNS O
that WDT O

According VBG O

Saudi NNP O

The DT O
surprise NN O
-- : O
for IN O
the DT O
US NNP O
administration NN O
and CC O
the DT O
US NNP O
media NNS O
-- : O
came VBD O
with IN O
a DT O
statement NN O
made VBN O
by IN O
Powell NNP O

Following VBG O
his PRP$ O
recent JJ O
world NN O
tours NNS O
, , O
Powell NNP O
suggested VBD O
that IN O
the DT O
President NNP O
accept VBP O
the DT O
validity NN O
of IN O
the DT O
Geneva NNP O
Convention NNP O
for IN O
the DT O
pro-Taliban JJ O
detainees NNS O
. . O

According VBG O
to TO O
his PRP$ O
own JJ O
assertions NNS O
, , O
the DT O
obvious JJ O
concern NN O
of IN O
some DT O
Western JJ O
European JJ O
leaders NNS O
-- : O
US NNP O
allies NNS O
-- : O
and CC O
of IN O
some DT O
important JJ O
European NNP O
governmental JJ O
and CC O
non-governmental JJ O
institutions NNS O
about IN O
the DT O
treatment NN O
the DT O
detainees NNS O
are VBP O
being VBG O
subjected VBN O
to TO O
, , O
especially RB O
following VBG O
the DT O
publication NN O
of IN O
certain JJ O
images NNS O
of IN O
the DT O
Guantanamo NNP O
Bay NNP O
camp NN O
that WDT O
could MD O
be VB O
interpreted VBN O
in IN O
various JJ O
ways NNS O
, , O
played VBD O
a DT O
key JJ O
role NN O
in IN O
this DT O
position NN O
. . O

Sometimes RB O
the DT O
criticism NN O
was VBD O
unexpectedly RB O
tough JJ O
: : O
Kenneth NNP O
Roth NNP O
, , O
executive JJ O
director NN O
of IN O
Human NNP O
Rights NNPS O
Watch NNP O
, , O
said VBD O
`` `` O
the DT O
US NNP O
Government NNP O
can MD O
not RB O
choose VB O
to TO O
wage NN O
war NN O
in IN O
Afghanistan NNP O
with IN O

and CC O
soldiers NNS O

and CC O
then RB O
assert VBP O
the DT O
laws NNS O
of IN O

do VBP O
not RB O
apply VB O

'' '' O

Therefore RB O
, , O
even RB O
if IN O
Powell NNP O
agrees VBZ O
with IN O
the DT O
refusal NN O
to TO O
grant VB O
prisoner-of-war JJ O
status NN O
to TO O
the DT O
158 CD O
captives NNS O
, , O
he PRP O
believe VBP O
that IN O
the DT O
US NNP O
refusal NN O
to TO O
cover VB O
the DT O
captives NNS O
under IN O
the DT O
Geneva NNP O
Convention NNP O
would MD O
set VB O
a DT O
precedent NN O
that WDT O
could MD O
affect VB O
the DT O
fate NN O
of IN O
US NNP O
soldiers NNS O
sent VBN O
out RP O
to TO O
risky JJ O
areas NNS O
of IN O
this DT O
planet NN O
. . O

In IN O
a DT O
first JJ O
phase NN O
, , O
the DT O
rest NN O
of IN O
the DT O
administration NN O
was VBD O
baffled VBN O
by IN O
Powell NNP O
's POS O
opinion NN O
, , O
but CC O
shortly RB O
afterward RB O
Rumsfeld NNP O
sided VBD O
with IN O
him PRP O
, , O
supporting VBG O
his PRP$ O
proposal NN O
in IN O
front NN O
of IN O
the DT O
President NNP O

According VBG O
to TO O
interpretations NNS O
on IN O
which WDT O
the DT O
individual NN O
in IN O
question NN O
refused VBD O
to TO O
comment VB O
, , O
Condoleezza NNP O
Rice NNP O
, , O
the DT O
US NNP O
President NNP O

national JJ O

adviser NN O
, , O
played VBD O
an DT O
important JJ O
role NN O
in IN O
supporting VBG O
Powell NNP O
's POS O
opinion NN O
. . O

Therefore RB O
, , O
the DT O
dispute NN O
of IN O
opinions NNS O
in IN O
the DT O
administration NN O
became VBD O
a DT O
lesson NN O
in IN O
applied JJ O
democracy NN O

Eventually RB O
, , O
making VBG O
a DT O
sum NN O
of IN O
the DT O
proposals NNS O
offered VBN O
by IN O
his PRP$ O
main JJ O
advisers NNS O
, , O
President NNP O
Bush NNP O
admitted VBD O
on RP O
Monday NNP O
, , O
following VBG O
the DT O
National NNP O
Security NNP O
Council NNP O
meeting NN O
, , O
that IN O
the DT O

will MD O
be VB O
covered VBN O
under IN O
the DT O
`` `` O

, , O
'' '' O
even RB O
if IN O
their PRP$ O
special JJ O

comes VBZ O
from IN O
the DT O
fact NN O
that IN O
they PRP O
will MD O
continue VB O
to TO O
be VB O
designated VBN O
terrorists NNS O
, , O
rather RB O
than IN O
prisoners NNS O
of IN O

As IN O
for IN O
their PRP$ O
possible JJ O
repatriation NN O
, , O
it PRP O
can MD O
not RB O
be VB O
taken VBN O
into IN O
consideration NN O
, , O
as RB O
long RB O
as IN O
the DT O
war NN O
against IN O
terrorism NN O
is VBZ O
far RB O
from IN O
over RB O
. . O

The DT O
fact NN O
that IN O
the DT O
President NNP O
reconsidered VBN O
his PRP$ O
own JJ O
statement NN O
of IN O
18 CD O
January NNP O
led VBD O
to TO O
diverse JJ O
reactions NNS O

There EX O
is VBZ O
irony NN O

including VBG O
from IN O
the DT O
sober NN O
The DT O
New NNP O

which WDT O
wrote VBD O

that IN O
in IN O

the DT O

`` `` O

then RB O
stopped VBD O
himself PRP O

and CC O
used VBD O
the DT O

` `` O

'' '' O

At IN O
first JJ O

this DT O
seems VBZ O
to TO O
be VB O
nothing NN O
more JJR O
than IN O
a DT O

However RB O
, , O
I PRP O
believe VBP O
it PRP O

more JJR O

In IN O
this DT O
concern NN O
about IN O

about IN O
cold-blood JJ O
