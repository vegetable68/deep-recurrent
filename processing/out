On 0
Monday 0
28 0
January 0
,
 0
the 0
US 0
National 0
Security 0
Council 0
convened 0
for 0
an 0
uncomfortable 0
meeting 0
;
 0
the 0
main 0
issue 0
to 1
be 1
debated 1
was 1
known 1
as 0
early 0
as 0
the 0
week 0
before 0
,
 0
following 0
an 0
unprecedented 0
split 0
that 0
had 0
emerged 0
in 0
the 0
US 0
Administration 0
.
 0
These 0
were 0
some 0
of 0
the 0
leaders 0
called 0
to 1
express 1
their 1
opinions 1
:
 1
Secretary 0
of 0
Defense 0
Donald 0
Rumsfeld 0
,
 0
Vice 0
President 0
Dick 0
Cheney 0

 0
Bush 0
and 0
Secretary 0
of 0
State 0
Colin 0

also 0
participated 0
in 0
this 0
business 0
.
 0
 0
	
 0
	
 0
The 0
issue 0
at 0
stake 0
was 0
apparently 0
simple 0
:
 0
the 0
status 0
of 0
the 0
detainees 0
,
 0
members 0
of 0
al 0
-
Qa 0
'
ida 0
and 0
Taliban 0
fighters 0
captured 0
by 0
US 0
troops 0
in 0
Afghanistan 0
in 0
recent 0
months 0
and 0
recently 0
transferred 0
to 0
a 0
detention 0
base 0
at 0
Guantanamo 0
Bay 0
.
 0
Eventually 0
,
 0
President 0
Bush 0
agreed 1
to 1
reconsider 1
some 0
of 0
the 0
decisions 1
he 1
had 0
announced 0
a 0
short 0
time 0
previously 0
.
 0
In 0
other 0
words 0
,
 0
he 0
admitted 1
he 1
had 0
been 0
wrong 0
 0
-
 0
-
 0
and 0
that 0
at 0
time 0
when 0
opinion 0
polls 0
in 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
are 0
,
 1
without 1
exception 1
,
 1
very 1
favorable 1
to 1
him 0
.
 0
 0
	
 0
	
 0
This 0
is 1
about 0
the 0
following 0
:
 0
on 0
18 0
January 0
2002 0
,
 0
President 0
Bush 0
publicly 0
announced 0
two 0
decisions 1
,
 1
which 1
,
 0
owing 0
to 0
the 0
President 0
'
s 0
firmness 0
in 0
announcing 0
them 0
,
 0
seemed 0
unyielding 0
:
 0
first 0
,
 0
the 0
President 0
said 0
the 0
158 0
pro 0
-
Taliban 0
fighters 0
brought 0
to 0
Guantanamo 0
Bay 0
were 0
not 0
defined 0
by 0
US 0
courts 0
as 0
prisoners 0
of 0
war 0
;
 0
therefore 0
,
 0
the 0
United 0
States 0
does 0
not 1
believe 1
it 1
is 1
its 0
duty 0
to 0
grant 0
them 0
prisoner 0
-
of 0
-
war 0
rights 0
under 0
the 0
Geneva 0
Convention 0
,
 0
which 0
regulates 0
 0
(
since 0
1949 0
)
 0
the 0
status 0
of 0
this 0
category 0
of 0
detained 0
combatants 0
.
 0
In 0
the 0
actual 0
situation 0
we 0
are 0
discussing 0
,
 0
the 0
issue 0
is 0
the 0
privileges 0
ensured 0
by 0
the 0
Convention 0
:
 0
according 0
to 0
that 0
act 0
,
 0
no 0
detained 0
combatant 0
can 0
be 0
forced 0
to 0
reveal 0
to 0
the 0
interrogator 0
anything 0
other 0
than 0
his 0
name 0
,
 0
rank 0
,
 0
military 0
serial 0
number 0
,
 0
and 0
birth 0
date 0
.
 0
And 0
,
 0
most 0
of 0
all 0
 0
-
 0
-
 0
this 0
is 0
a 0
very 0
important 0
detail 0
in 0
this 0
case 0
 0
-
 0
-
 0
the 0
Convention 0
forces 0
the 0
country 0
that 0
holds 0
prisoners 0
of 0
war 0
to 0
release 0
them 0
immediately 0
when 0
the 0
conflict 0
is 0
over 0
.
 0
 0
	
 0
	
 0
In 0
all 0
likelihood 0
,
 0
President 0
Bush 0
made 0
that 0
statement 0
on 0
18 0
January 0
following 0
a 0
consultation 0
 0
-
 0
-
 0
which 0
was 0
 0
"
rather 0
brief 0
,
 0
"
 0
some 0

observers 0
believe 0

-
 0
-
 1
with 1
Ashcroft 0
,
 0
who 0
was 0
strongly 1
supported 1
by 1
Cheney 1
.
 0
Obviously 0
,
 1
this 0
decision 1
simplified 0
things 0
,
 0
and 0
it 0
allowed 0
the 0
US 0
judiciary 0
to 0
conduct 0
the 0
investigation 0
of 0
the 0
158 0
detainees 0
as 0
it 0
sees 0
fit 0
.
 0
The 0
United 1
States 0
wanted 0
this 1
very 1
much 1
,
 1
because 1
so 0
far 0
the 0
identity 0
and 0
citizenship 0
of 0
those 0
they 0
call 0
 0
"
terrorists 0

or 0
 0

killers 0

 0
in 0

)
 0
rather 0
than 0
prisoners 0
in 0
a 0
conventional 0
war 0
have 0
not 0
been 0
published 0
for 0
reasons 0
that 0
are 0
easy 0
to 0
understand 0
.
 0
According 0
to 0
information 0
circulated 0
by 0
the 0
main 0
US 0
newspapers 0
,
 0
the 0
detainees 0
are 0

 0

 0

Saudi 0
Interior 0

said 0
that 0

 0
The 0
surprise 0
 1
-
 1
-
 1
for 1
the 1
US 0
administration 0
and 0
the 0
US 0
media 0
 0
-
 0
-
 0
came 0
with 0
a 0
statement 0
made 0
by 0
Powell 0
.
 0
Following 0
his 0
recent 0
world 0
tours 0
,
 0
Powell 0
suggested 0
that 1
the 1
President 0
accept 0
the 0
validity 0
of 0
the 0
Geneva 0
Convention 0
for 0
the 0
pro 0
-
Taliban 0
detainees 0
.
 0
According 0
to 0
his 1
own 1
assertions 1
,
 1
the 1
obvious 1
concern 1
of 1
some 1
Western 0
European 0
leaders 0
 0
-
 0
-
 0
US 0
allies 0
 0
-
 0
-
 0
and 0
of 0
some 0
important 0
European 0
governmental 0
and 0
non 0
-
governmental 0
institutions 0
about 0
the 0
treatment 0
the 0
detainees 0
are 0
being 0
subjected 0
to 0
,
 0
especially 0
following 0
the 0
publication 0
of 0
certain 0
images 0
of 0
the 0
Guantanamo 0
Bay 0
camp 0
that 0
could 0
be 0
interpreted 0
in 0
various 0
ways 0
,
 0
played 0
a 0
key 0
role 0
in 0
this 0
position 1
.
 1
Sometimes 1
the 1
criticism 1
was 1
unexpectedly 0
tough 0
:
 0
Kenneth 0
Roth 0
,
 0
executive 0
director 0
of 0
Human 0
Rights 0
Watch 0
,
 0
said 0
 0
"
the 0
US 0
Government 0
cannot 0
choose 0
to 0
wage 0
war 0
in 0
Afghanistan 0
with 0
guns 0
,
 0
bombs 0
and 0
soldiers 0
,
 0
and 0
then 0
assert 0
the 0
laws 1
of 1
war 0
do 0
not 0
apply 0
.
 0
"
 0
Therefore 0
,
 0
even 0
if 0
Powell 0
agrees 0
with 0
the 1
refusal 0
to 1
grant 1
prisoner 1
-
of 1
-
war 0
status 0
to 0
the 0
158 0
captives 0
,
 0
he 0
believe 0
that 0
the 1
US 1
refusal 0
to 0
cover 1
the 1
captives 0
under 0
the 0
Geneva 0
Convention 0
would 0
set 0
a 0
precedent 0
that 0
could 0
affect 0
the 0
fate 0
of 0
US 0
soldiers 0
sent 0
out 0
to 0
risky 0
areas 0
of 0
this 0
planet 0
.
 0
In 0
a 0
first 0
phase 0
,
 0
the 0
rest 0
of 0
the 0
administration 0
was 0
baffled 0
by 1
Powell 1
'
s 1
opinion 0
,
 0
but 0
shortly 0
afterward 0
Rumsfeld 0
sided 0
with 0
him 1
,
 1
supporting 0
his 1
proposal 1
in 0
front 0
of 0
the 0
President 0
.
 0
According 0
to 0
interpretations 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
individual 0
in 0
question 0
refused 0
to 0
comment 1
,
 1
Condoleezza 0
Rice 0
,
 0
the 0
US 0
President 0
'
s 0
national 0
security 0
adviser 0
,
 0
played 0
an 0
important 0
role 0
in 0
supporting 0
Powell 1
'
s 1
opinion 0
.
 0
 0
	
 0
	
 0
Therefore 0
,
 0
the 0
dispute 0
of 0
opinions 1
in 1
the 1
administration 0
became 0
a 0
lesson 0
in 0
applied 0
democracy 0
.
 0
Eventually 0
,
 0
making 0
a 0
sum 0
of 0
the 0
proposals 0
offered 1
by 1
his 1
main 1
advisers 0
,
 0
President 0
Bush 0
admitted 0
on 0
Monday 1
,
 1
following 0
the 0
National 0
Security 0
Council 0
meeting 0
,
 0
that 0
the 0
captives 0
at 0
Guantanamo 0
Bay 0
will 0
be 0
covered 0
under 0
the 0
 0
"
spirit 0
of 0
the 0
Geneva 0
Convention 0
,
 0
"
 0
even 0
if 0
their 0
special 0
status 0
comes 0
from 0
the 0
fact 0
that 0
they 0
will 0
continue 0
to 0
be 0
designated 0
terrorists 0
,
 0
rather 0
than 0
prisoners 0
of 0
war 0
.
 0
As 0
for 0
their 0
possible 0
repatriation 0
,
 0
it 0
cannot 0
be 0
taken 1
into 0
consideration 0
,
 0
as 0
long 0
as 0
the 0
war 0
against 0
terrorism 0
is 0
far 0
from 0
over 0
.
 0
 0
	
 0
	
 0
The 0
fact 0
that 0
the 0
President 0
reconsidered 0
his 0
own 1
statement 1
of 0
18 0
January 0
led 0
to 0
diverse 0
reactions 0
.
 0
There 1
is 1
irony 1
 1
-
 1
-
 1
including 0
from 0
the 0
sober 0
The 0
New 0

Times 0
 0
,
 0
which 0
wrote 0
in 0
its 0
Tuesday 0
issue 0
that 0
in 0
his 0
Monday 0
speech 0
the 0

 0

called 0

,
 0
'
 0
then 0
stopped 0
himself 0
,
 0
and 0
used 0
the 0
word 0
 0
'
detainees 0
.
 0
'
 0
"
 0
At 0
first 0
sight 0
,
 0
this 1
seems 0
to 0
be 0
nothing 0
more 0
than 0
a 0
terminology 0
issue 0
.
 0
However 0
,
 0
I 0
believe 0
it 0
is 0
more 0
than 1
that 0
.
 0
In 0
this 0
concern 0

 0

 0

 0
about 0

proves 0

capable 0
of 0

 0

is 0
the 0
equivalent 0
of 0

 0

,
 0
as 0
a 0
last 0
detail 0
,
 0
let 0
us 0
remember 0
that 0

 0
harassed 0
everywhere 0
