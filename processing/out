On O
Monday O
28 O
January O
, O
the O
US O
National O
Security O
Council O
convened O
for O
an O
uncomfortable O
meeting O
; O
the O
main O
issue O
to O
be O
debated O
was O
known O
as O
early O
as O
the O
week O
before O
, O
following O
an O
unprecedented O
split O
that O
had O
emerged O
in O
the O
US O
Administration O
. O
These O
were O
some O
of O
the B
leaders I
called O
to O
express O
their O
opinions O
: O
Secretary O
of O
Defense O
Donald O
Rumsfeld O
, O
Vice O
President O
Dick O
Cheney O
, O
John O
Ashcroft O
( O
general O
prosecutor O
and O
chief O
of O
the O
Justice O
Department O
) O
, O
CIA O
Director O
George O
Tenet O
, O
General O
Richard O
B O
. O
Myers O
, O
chairman O
of O
the O
Joint O
Chiefs O
of O
Staff O
, O
and O
others O
. O
President O
George O
W O
. O
Bush O
and O
Secretary O
of O
State O
Colin O
Powell O
also O
participated O
in O
this O
business O
. O
The O
issue O
at O
stake O
was O
apparently O
simple O
: O
the O
status O
of O
the O
detainees O
, O
members O
of O
al O
- O
Qa O
' O
ida O
and O
Taliban O
fighters O
captured O
by O
US O
troops O
in O
Afghanistan O
in O
recent O
months O
and O
recently O
transferred O
to O
a O
detention O
base O
at O
Guantanamo O
Bay O
. O
Eventually O
, O
President B
Bush I
agreed O
to O
reconsider O
some O
of O
the O
decisions O
he B
had O
announced O
a O
short O
time O
previously O
. O
In O
other O
words O
, O
he B
admitted O
he O
had O
been O
wrong O
- O
- O
and O
that O
at O
time O
when O
opinion B
polls I
in O
the O
United O
States O
are O
, O
without O
exception O
, O
very O
favorable O
to O
him O
. O
This O
is O
about O
the O
following O
: O
on O
18 O
January O
2002 O
, O
President B
Bush I
publicly O
announced O
two O
decisions O
, O
which O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
President O
' O
s O
firmness O
in O
announcing O
them O
, O
seemed O
unyielding O
: O
first O
, O
the B
President I
said O
the O
158 O
pro O
- O
Taliban O
fighters O
brought O
to O
Guantanamo O
Bay O
were O
not O
defined O
by O
US O
courts O
as O
prisoners O
of O
war O
; O
therefore O
, O
the B
United I
States I
does O
not O
believe O
it O
is O
its O
duty O
to O
grant O
them O
prisoner O
- O
of O
- O
war O
rights O
under O
the O
Geneva O
Convention O
, O
which O
regulates O
( O
since O
1949 O
) O
the O
status O
of O
this O
category O
of O
detained O
combatants O
. O
In O
the O
actual O
situation O
we B
are O
discussing O
, O
the O
issue O
is O
the O
privileges O
ensured O
by O
the O
Convention O
: O
according O
to O
that B
act I
, O
no O
detained O
combatant O
can O
be O
forced O
to O
reveal O
to O
the O
interrogator O
anything O
other O
than O
his O
name O
, O
rank O
, O
military O
serial O
number O
, O
and O
birth O
date O
. O
And O
, O
most O
of O
all O
- O
- O
this O
is O
a O
very O
important O
detail O
in O
this O
case O
- O
- O
the O
Convention O
forces O
the O
country O
that O
holds O
prisoners O
of O
war O
to O
release O
them O
immediately O
when O
the O
conflict O
is O
over O
. O
In O
all O
likelihood O
, O
President B
Bush I
made O
that O
statement O
on O
18 O
January O
following O
a O
consultation O
- O
- O
which O
was O
" O
rather O
brief O
, O
" O
some B
US I
observers I
believe O
- O
- O
with O
Ashcroft O
, O
who O
was O
strongly O
supported O
by O
Cheney B
. O
Obviously O
, O
this O
decision O
simplified O
things O
, O
and O
it O
allowed O
the O
US O
judiciary O
to O
conduct O
the O
investigation O
of O
the O
158 O
detainees O
as O
it O
sees O
fit O
. O
The B
United I
States I
wanted O
this O
very O
much O
, O
because O
so O
far O
the O
identity O
and O
citizenship O
of O
those O
they B
call O
" O
terrorists O
" O
( O
or O
" O
killers O
" O
in O
Bush B
' O
s O
languages O
without O
nuances O
) O
rather O
than O
prisoners O
in O
a O
conventional O
war O
have O
not O
been O
published O
for O
reasons O
that O
are O
easy O
to O
understand O
. O
According O
to O
information B
circulated I
by I
the I
main I
US I
newspapers I
, O
the O
detainees O
are O
citizens O
of O
25 O
countries O
, O
including O
England O
, O
France O
, O
Australia O
, O
Yemen O
, O
Algeria O
, O
and O
even O
Sweden O
( O
! O
) O
. O
Saudi B
Arabia I
alone O
says O
" O
more O
than O
100 O
" O
of O
the O
158 O
are O
Saudi O
citizens O
( O
a O
figure O
the B
Americans I
see O
as O
exaggerated O
) O
, O
and O
Saudi B
Interior I
Minister I
Prince I
Saud I
Nayif I
recently O
said O
that O
his B
country I
would O
like O
to O
have O
them O
repatriated O
, O
to O
be O
tried O
at O
home O
. O
The O
surprise O
- O
- O
for O
the B
US I
administration I
and I
the I
US I
media I
- O
- O
came O
with O
a O
statement O
made O
by O
Powell B
. O
Following O
his O
recent O
world O
tours O
, O
Powell B
suggested O
that O
the B
President I
accept O
the O
validity O
of O
the O
Geneva O
Convention O
for O
the O
pro O
- O
Taliban O
detainees O
. O
According O
to O
his B
own O
assertions O
, O
the O
obvious O
concern O
of O
some B
Western I
European I
leaders I
- I
- I
US I
allies I
- I
- I
and I
of I
some I
important I
European I
governmental I
and I
non I
- I
governmental I
institutions I
about O
the O
treatment O
the O
detainees O
are O
being O
subjected O
to O
, O
especially O
following O
the O
publication O
of O
certain O
images O
of O
the O
Guantanamo O
Bay O
camp O
that O
could O
be O
interpreted O
in O
various O
ways O
, O
played O
a O
key O
role O
in O
this O
position O
. O
Sometimes O
the O
criticism O
was O
unexpectedly O
tough O
: O
Kenneth B
Roth I
, I
executive I
director I
of I
Human I
Rights I
Watch I
, O
said O
" O
the B
US I
Government I
cannot O
choose O
to O
wage O
war O
in O
Afghanistan O
with O
guns O
, O
bombs O
and O
soldiers O
, O
and O
then O
assert O
the O
laws O
of O
war O
do O
not O
apply O
. O
" O
Therefore O
, O
even O
if O
Powell B
agrees O
with O
the O
refusal O
to O
grant O
prisoner O
- O
of O
- O
war O
status O
to O
the O
158 O
captives O
, O
he B
believe O
that O
the B
US I
refusal O
to O
cover O
the O
captives O
under O
the O
Geneva O
Convention O
would O
set O
a O
precedent O
that O
could O
affect O
the O
fate O
of O
US O
soldiers O
sent O
out O
to O
risky O
areas O
of O
this O
planet O
. O
In O
a O
first O
phase O
, O
the B
rest I
of I
the I
administration I
was O
baffled O
by O
Powell B
' O
s O
opinion O
, O
but O
shortly O
afterward O
Rumsfeld B
sided O
with O
him O
, O
supporting O
his B
proposal O
in O
front O
of O
the O
President O
. O
According O
to O
interpretations O
on O
which O
the B
individual I
in I
question I
refused O
to O
comment O
, O
Condoleezza B
Rice I
, O
the O
US O
President O
' O
s O
national O
security O
adviser O
, O
played O
an O
important O
role O
in O
supporting O
Powell B
' O
s O
opinion O
. O
Therefore O
, O
the O
dispute O
of O
opinions O
in O
the B
administration I
became O
a O
lesson O
in O
applied O
democracy O
. O
Eventually O
, O
making O
a O
sum O
of O
the O
proposals O
offered O
by O
his B
main I
advisers I
, O
President B
Bush I
admitted O
on O
Monday O
, O
following O
the O
National O
Security O
Council O
meeting O
, O
that O
the O
captives O
at O
Guantanamo O
Bay O
will O
be O
covered O
under O
the O
" O
spirit O
of O
the O
Geneva O
Convention O
, O
" O
even O
if O
their O
special O
status O
comes O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
designated O
terrorists O
, O
rather O
than O
prisoners O
of O
war O
. O
As O
for O
their O
possible O
repatriation O
, O
it O
cannot O
be O
taken O
into O
consideration O
, O
as O
long O
as O
the O
war O
against O
terrorism O
is O
far O
from O
over O
. O
The O
fact O
that O
the B
President I
reconsidered O
his B
own O
statement O
of O
18 O
January O
led O
to O
diverse O
reactions O
. O
There O
is O
irony O
- O
- O
including O
from O
the O
sober O
The B
New I
York I
Times I
, O
which O
wrote O
in O
its O
Tuesday O
issue O
that O
in O
his B
Monday O
speech O
the B
President I
" O
twice O
called O
the O
158 O
pro O
- O
Taliban O
fighters O
' O
prisoners O
, O
' O
then O
stopped O
himself O
, O
and O
used O
the O
word O
' O
detainees O
. O
' O
" O
At O
first O
sight O
, O
this O
seems O
to O
be O
nothing O
more O
than O
a O
terminology O
issue O
. O
However O
, O
I B
believe O
it O
is O
more O
than O
that O
. O
In O
this O
concern O
about O
details O
- O
- O
about O
cold O
- O
blood O
accomplices O
to O
murder O
, O
because O
that O
is O
what O
these O
al O
- O
Qa O
' O
ida O
disciples O
at O
Guantanamo O
Bay O
are O
- O
- O
the B
US I
Administration I
proves O
it O
is O
capable O
of O
admitting O
it O
is O
not O
infallible O
, O
which O
is O
the O
equivalent O
of O
respect O
for O
democracy O
. O
And O
, O
as O
a O
last O
detail O
, O
let O
us O
remember O
that O
, O
harassed O
everywhere O
by O
journalists O
and O
commentators O
, O
no B
US I
leader I
ever O
thought O
of O
finding O
" O
monkeys O
" O
[ O
reference O
to O
a O
statement O
made O
by O
Romanian B
Prime I
Minister I
Adrian I
Nastase I
] O
among O
media O
workers O
or O
scapegoats O
among O
the B
weirdoes I
who O
use O
hundreds O
of O
websites O
to O
call O
on O
the O
administration O
to O
stop O
supporting O
the O
Jews O
or O
to O
exterminate O
the O
Arabs O
