I	PRP	O

mainly	RB	O
because	IN	O
it	PRP	O

that	IN	O
the	DT	O

not	RB	O
true	JJ	O
and	CC	O
that	IN	O
it	PRP	O
was	VBD	O
we	PRP	O

as	IN	O

as	RB	O
working	VBG	O

All	DT	O

my	PRP$	O

learned	VBD	O
to	TO	O
cook	VB	O
by	IN	O
the	DT	O

I	PRP	O
learned	VBD	O
after	IN	O
I	PRP	O

so	IN	O
I	PRP	O

either	CC	O

that	IN	O
I	PRP	O
was	VBD	O
going	VBG	O

Once	RB	O

That	DT	O

in	IN	O
the	DT	O

we	PRP	O

I	PRP	O
never	RB	O

because	RB	O
of	IN	O
this	DT	O

Uh	NNP	O
,	,	O
while	IN	O
I	PRP	O
was	VBD	O
in	IN	O
high	JJ	O

a	DT	O

I	PRP	O

my	PRP$	O

my	PRP$	O

But	CC	O
because	IN	O

At	IN	O

was	VBD	O
in	IN	O
prison	NN	O
at	IN	O
the	DT	O

so	IN	O
it	PRP	O
made	VBD	O

my	PRP$	O

I	PRP	O

even	RB	O
keep	VB	O

on	IN	O
the	DT	O

one	CD	O

my	PRP$	O

an	DT	O

And	CC	O
I	PRP	O
went	VBD	O

uh	NNP	O
I	PRP	O
wo	MD	O
n't	RB	O

the	DT	O

Who	WP	O

I	PRP	O
do	VBP	O

in	IN	O
the	DT	O

I	PRP	O
'll	MD	O

one	CD	O

I	PRP	O

I	PRP	O
looked	VBD	O

my	PRP$	O

I	PRP	O

I	PRP	O

it	PRP	O

Out	IN	O
of	IN	O
150	CD	O

who	WP	O
had	VBD	O

this	DT	O

only	RB	O
16	CD	O
got	VBD	O
the	DT	O

,	,	O
so	IN	O
I	PRP	O
felt	VBD	B
very	RB	I
proud	JJ	I
of	IN	O
myself	PRP	O
.	.	O

So	CC	O
I	PRP	O
went	VBD	O
on	RP	O
and	CC	O
took	VBD	O
the	DT	O

,	,	O
and	CC	O
as	IN	O
I	PRP	O
started	VBD	O
I	PRP	O
think	VBP	B
I	PRP	O
was	VBD	O
taking	VBG	O
economics	NNS	O

I	PRP	O
think	VBP	B
that	IN	O
was	VBD	O
the	DT	O
last	JJ	O

I	PRP	O
took	VBD	O
.	.	O

My	PRP$	O
husband	NN	O
became	VBD	O
very	RB	O
ill	JJ	O
with	IN	O
cancer	NN	O
and	CC	O
I	PRP	O

to	TO	O
make	VB	O
a	DT	O

as	RB	O
to	TO	O
whether	IN	O
I	PRP	O
would	MD	O
continue	VB	O
my	PRP$	O

take	VB	O

of	IN	O
him	PRP	O
and	CC	O
I	PRP	O
felt	VBD	B
like	IN	O
I	PRP	O
needed	VBD	O
to	TO	O
take	VB	O
care	NN	O
of	IN	O
him	PRP	O
because	IN	O
he	PRP	O
stood	VBD	B
by	IN	I
me	PRP	O
so	RB	O
much	RB	O
while	IN	O
I	PRP	O
was	VBD	O
going	VBG	O
to	TO	O
school	NN	O
.	.	O

But	CC	O
you	PRP	O
would	MD	O
have	VB	O
been	VBN	O
able	JJ	O
to	TO	O
be	VB	O
a	SYM	O
,	,	O
a	DT	O
teacher	NN	O
if	IN	O
you	PRP	O
had	VBD	O
continued	VBN	O
?	.	O

Yeah	UH	O
,	,	O
and	VB	O
at	IN	O
the	DT	O
time	NN	O
,	,	O
I	PRP	O
was	VBD	O
also	RB	O
working	VBG	O
in	IN	O
the	DT	O
classroom	NN	O
.	.	O

I	PRP	O
guess	VBP	B
you	PRP	I
'd	MD	I
say	VB	I
as	IN	O
a	DT	O
sub	NN	O
because	IN	O
the	DT	O
teacher	NN	O
that	IN	O
I	PRP	O
was	VBD	O
working	VBG	O
with	IN	O
at	IN	O
that	DT	O
time	NN	O
was	VBD	O
pregnant	JJ	O
and	CC	O
she	PRP	O
had	VBD	O
to	TO	O
take	VB	O
a	DT	O
leave	NN	O
of	IN	O
absence	NN	O
.	.	O

And	CC	O
they	PRP	O
hired	VBD	O
a	DT	O
sub	NN	O
but	CC	O
the	DT	O
sub	NN	O
did	VBD	O
n't	RB	O
do	VB	O
that	DT	O
much	JJ	O
.	.	O

I	PRP	O
had	VBD	O
to	TO	O
take	VB	O
over	RP	O
the	DT	O
classroom	NN	O
.	.	O

So	IN	O
I	PRP	O
worked	VBD	O
maybe	RB	O
like	IN	O
four	CD	O
months	NNS	O
in	IN	O
the	DT	O
classroom	NN	O
and	CC	O
that	WDT	O
highly	RB	O
put	VBD	O
a	DT	O
damper	NN	O
on	IN	O
my	PRP$	O
wanting	NN	B
to	TO	O
be	VB	O
a	DT	O
teacher	NN	O
from	IN	O
all	PDT	O
the	DT	O
responsibility	NN	O
along	IN	O

the	DT	O
fact	NN	O
that	IN	O
I	PRP	O
was	VBD	O
taking	VBG	O
care	NN	O
of	IN	O
a	DT	O
very	RB	O
sick	JJ	O
husband	NN	O

After	IN	O
all	DT	O
of	IN	O
this	DT	O
was	VBD	O
,	,	O
after	IN	O
I	PRP	O
,	,	O
I	PRP	O
decided	VBD	B
not	RB	O
to	TO	O
continue	VB	O
I	PRP	O
've	VBP	O
never	RB	O
pursued	VBN	O
the	DT	O
fact	NN	O
of	IN	O
going	VBG	O
back	RP	O
to	TO	O

I	PRP	O
just	RB	O
got	VBD	O
to	TO	O
a	DT	O
certain	JJ	O
age	NN	O
and	CC	O
I	PRP	O
said	VBD	B

``	``	O
No	UH	O
I	PRP	O
ca	MD	O
n't	RB	O

this	DT	O

,	,	O
''	''	O
so	IN	O
I	PRP	O
never	RB	O
went	VBD	O
back	RB	O

But	CC	O
I	PRP	O
love	VBP	B
what	WP	O
I	PRP	O
do	VBP	O
and	CC	O
,	,	O
uh	UH	O
,	,	O
anytime	VB	O
I	PRP	O
get	VB	O
a	DT	O
chance	NN	O
to	TO	O
teach	VB	O
in	IN	O
a	DT	O
classroom	NN	O
I	PRP	O
go	VBP	B
for	IN	I
it	PRP	O
so	RB	O
.	.	O

How	WRB	O
many	JJ	O
different	JJ	O
schools	NNS	O
did	VBD	O
you	PRP	O
teach	VB	O
at	IN	O
?	.	O

I	PRP	O
've	VBP	O
only	RB	O
worked	VBN	O
at	IN	O
two	CD	O

two	CD	O

The	DT	O
first	JJ	O
school	NN	O
I	PRP	O
worked	VBD	O
at	IN	O
was	VBD	O
Enderly	NNP	O
Park	NNP	O
and	CC	O
then	RB	O
it	PRP	O
was	VBD	O
closed	VBN	O

I	PRP	O

in	IN	O
those	DT	O

I	PRP	O
first	JJ	O

So	CC	O
I	PRP	O

I	PRP	O
was	VBD	O
offered	VBN	O
a	DT	O

I	PRP	O

because	IN	O
I	PRP	O
loved	VBD	B
being	VBG	O

I	PRP	O
fell	VBD	B
in	IN	I

If	IN	O
