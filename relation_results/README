Testing on Bishan's data and her datasplits

relation -> rel.out (no backprop, add all vectors up and average)
relation_backprop -> back.out (backprop, add all vectors up and average)
rel_back2 -> back2.out (the forward and backward node of the last and the first of the span, backprop)
rel_back3 -> back3.out (backward node of the first and the forward of the last, backprop)
